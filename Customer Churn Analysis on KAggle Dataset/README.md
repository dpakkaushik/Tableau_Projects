### **Customer Churn Analysis**

Customer churn, or attrition, is the rate at which clients opt out of purchasing more of a company’s products or services. Customer churn analysis is a method of measuring this rate. The churn rate **formula** is: **(Lost Customers ÷ Total Customers at the Start of Time Period) x 100**
